# Utilities
Calculate rent and utilities for me and my housemates

This script reads data from a present/absent file in .csv format exported from Google Sheets. It then takes several inputs from the user related to utility bill amounts, billing dates, and base rent for each housemate and calculates the appropriate discounts and totals owed by each housemate. The outputs include appropriate discounts for absences for vacation, or moving in/out.
